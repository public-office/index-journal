              ** CMOS 14.63 Dividing a bibliography into sections**. A bibliography may occasionally be divided into sections—but only if doing so would make the reader's job significantly easier. It may be appropriate to subdivide a bibliography (1) when it includes manuscript sources, archival collections, or other materials that do not fit into a straight alphabetical list; (2) when readers need to see at a glance the distinction between different kinds of works— for example, in a study of one writer, between works by the writer and those about him or her; or (3) when the bibliography is intended primarily as a guide to further reading (as in this manual). When divisions are necessary, a headnote should appear at the beginning of the bibliogra-phy, and each section should be introduced by an explanatory subhead (see fig. 14.9). No source should be listed in more than one section.
